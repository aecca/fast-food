## Getting Started

Install dependencies with composer:

```bash
$ composer install
```

After choosing and installing the packages you want, go to the
`<project-path>` and start PHP's built-in web server to verify installation:

```bash
$ composer serve
```

You can then browse to http://localhost:8080.
